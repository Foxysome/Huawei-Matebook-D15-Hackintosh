This is just the standalone EFI file i used to install MacOS Ventura. Please change the SMBios. The used SMBios was MacbookPro16,3. Heres how to do it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MsueH5EouQ After downloading don't copy the README.md file to your USB drive. If you have any trouble booting/installing ad "-v" to the front of your boot-args, so you can figure out what's wrong.
When in bootloader press (space) and select dmg.
