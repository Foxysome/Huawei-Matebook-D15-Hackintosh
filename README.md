This is just the standalone EFI file i used to install MacOS Ventura. Please change the SMBios. The used SMBios was MacbookPro16,3. Heres how to do it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MsueH5EouQ After downloading don't copy the README.md file to your USB drive. If you have any trouble booting/installing add "-v" to the front of your boot-args, so you can figure out what's wrong.
When in bootloader press (space) and select dmg.
Also, make sure you create an "EFI" file and put the "BOOT" and "OC" files in it.
